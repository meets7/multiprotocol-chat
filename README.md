# MultiProtocol chat client - desktop and android clients

This is a cross-platform communication solution which could integrate multiple protocols. The solution was built using Java and was portable on many platforms without changing the core code base. We successfully demonstrated the solution on Windows, Linux and Android systems. As a prototype, we integrated the Facebook and Google (formerly XMPP) chat protocols.

Google and Facebook have both changed their chat protocols and migrated away from xmpp. The current state of the application is not known. Last tested February 2014.
